# Claude Code Skills Repository

A collection of modular skill packages that extend Claude Code's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are self-contained packages that transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge for specific domains or tasks. Think of them as "onboarding guides" that provide:

- **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for complex tasks
- **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats, APIs, or frameworks
- **Domain expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, and business logic
- **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, templates, and assets for complex tasks

### How Skills Work

Skills use a progressive disclosure design with three loading levels:

1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always loaded (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - Loaded when skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - Loaded as needed (scripts/, references/, assets/)

This approach minimizes context usage while providing Claude with the right information at the right time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed and configured
- Skills directory at `~/.claude/skills/` (created automatically by Claude Code)

### Installing Skills

#### Option 1: Install via gitpick (Recommended)

The fastest and easiest way to install individual skills directly from GitHub:

**User-level installation:**
```bash
npx gitpick shawn-sandy/acss/tree/main/.claude/skills/{skill-name} ~/.claude/skills/{skill-name}
```

**Project-specific installation:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npx gitpick shawn-sandy/acss/tree/main/.claude/skills/{skill-name} ./.claude/skills/{skill-name}
```

**Example - Installing the npm-monorepo-publish skill:**
```bash
npx gitpick shawn-sandy/acss/tree/main/.claude/skills/npm-monorepo-publish ~/.claude/skills/npm-monorepo-publish
```

**Why gitpick?**
- ✅ Single command - no ZIP download or extraction
- ✅ Selective cloning - only downloads the skill folder
- ✅ Zero dependencies - lightweight and fast (<35kb)
- ✅ Always up-to-date - pulls latest version from GitHub

#### Option 2: Clone from GitHub

Clone the entire repository or individual skill directories:

```bash
# Clone the entire repository
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/acss.git acss-repo

# Copy specific skills to your skills directory
cp -r acss-repo/.claude/skills/{skill-name} ~/.claude/skills/

# Or copy all skills
cp -r acss-repo/.claude/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Option 3: Manual Copy

Copy individual skill directories:

```bash
# After downloading or cloning, copy to skills directory
cp -r /path/to/skill-name ~/.claude/skills/
```

Verify installation by checking that skills appear in Claude Code's available skills list.

### Installing from ZIP Packages

If you received a skill as a ZIP file:

1. Extract the ZIP file:
```bash
unzip skill-name-v1.0.0.zip
```

2. Copy the extracted directory to your skills folder:
```bash
cp -r skill-name ~/.claude/skills/
```

3. Verify the skill appears in Claude Code's available skills.

## Skill Structure

Every skill follows this standard directory structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)           # Main skill prompt with YAML frontmatter
├── LICENSE.txt (optional)        # License information
├── scripts/                      # Executable code (Python/Bash)
│   └── example_script.py
├── references/                   # Documentation loaded as needed
│   └── detailed_guide.md
├── templates/                    # Output templates
│   └── example_template.md
└── assets/                       # Files used in output
    └── logo.png
```

### SKILL.md Requirements

Every SKILL.md must include:

**YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name                  # Required: lowercase, hyphen-case, max 40 chars
description: Clear description    # Required: when to use this skill
version: X.Y.Z                    # Optional: defaults to 0.1.0
license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt  # Optional
---
```

**Markdown Content:**
- Purpose and overview
- When to use the skill
- Step-by-step workflow
- References to bundled resources

### Bundled Resources

**scripts/** - Executable code for deterministic tasks:
- Use when code is repeatedly rewritten or reliability is critical
- Common languages: Python, Bash
- Should include proper shebang and be executable
- May include dependencies (requirements.txt, package.json)

**references/** - Documentation loaded into context as needed:
- Database schemas, API docs, detailed guides
- Loaded only when Claude determines it's needed
- For large files (>10k words), include grep patterns in SKILL.md

**templates/** - Files used to generate output:
- Markdown templates with variable substitution
- Use `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` for substitution points

**assets/** - Files copied/used in output:
- Not loaded into context
- Images, fonts, boilerplate code, sample documents

## Creating New Skills

### Quick Start

1. Use the `skill-creator` skill in Claude Code:
   - Describe what the skill should do
   - Provide concrete usage examples
   - Claude will guide you through the creation process

2. Or initialize manually using the included script:

```bash
python skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py my-new-skill --path ~/.claude/skills/
```

3. Edit the generated SKILL.md and add bundled resources as needed.

### Validation

Validate your skill structure before distribution:

```bash
python skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py ~/.claude/skills/my-new-skill/
```

This checks:
- YAML frontmatter format and required fields
- Naming conventions
- Description quality
- File organization

## Packaging for Distribution

Use the `skill-packager` skill to create distributable ZIP files:

```bash
python skill-packager/scripts/package_and_document.py \
  --skill-path ~/.claude/skills/my-skill \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --output-dir ~/.claude/downloads/my-skill
```

This generates:
- **my-skill-v1.0.0.zip** - Versioned skill package
- **my-skill-Download.md** - Installation instructions
- **my-skill-doc.md** - User documentation

### Semantic Versioning

Skills use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **Patch** (X.Y.Z+1) - Bug fixes, documentation updates
- **Minor** (X.Y+1.0) - New features, backward-compatible changes
- **Major** (X+1.0.0) - Breaking changes, major refactors

## Development Workflow

### Creating a New Skill

1. **Understand the use case** - Gather concrete examples
2. **Plan resources** - Identify needed scripts, references, assets
3. **Initialize** - Create skill directory and SKILL.md
4. **Implement** - Write SKILL.md and add bundled resources
5. **Test** - Use the skill with real tasks
6. **Iterate** - Refine based on performance
7. **Package** - Create distributable ZIP for sharing

### Updating an Existing Skill

1. **Make changes** - Edit SKILL.md or bundled resources
2. **Increment version** - Update version in SKILL.md frontmatter
3. **Test** - Verify improvements with real tasks
4. **Re-package** - Generate new versioned ZIP

### Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each skill should have one clear purpose
2. **Self-Contained** - Skills should work independently
3. **Clear Triggers** - Description should make it obvious when to use
4. **Lean SKILL.md** - Move detailed content to reference files
5. **Validation** - Always validate before distribution
6. **Versioning** - Increment version on any changes
7. **Documentation** - Keep README.md and docs up to date

## Project-Specific Configuration

```bash
python skill-packager/scripts/package_and_document.py \
  --skill-path <path/to/skill> \
  --version <X.Y.Z> \
  --output-dir <output-directory>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Loading

- Verify SKILL.md exists in skill directory
- Check YAML frontmatter is valid (proper `---` delimiters)
- Ensure `name` and `description` fields are present
- Verify skill directory is in `~/.claude/skills/`

### Packaging Errors

- Validate SKILL.md structure before packaging
- Check version format is valid (X.Y.Z)
- Ensure all referenced files exist
- Verify output directory has write permissions

### Script Execution Issues

- Check script has execute permissions (`chmod +x script.sh`)
- Verify Python version (>=3.7 recommended)
- Install dependencies if requirements.txt exists
- Check shebang points to correct interpreter
