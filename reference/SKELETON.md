# Plan: <title>

## Context

<why this work is needed, and what a reader with no prior context requires to
act — relevant files, prior decisions, constraints. No follow-up question
should be necessary, including from a future session after context is
cleared.>

## Objective

<one or two sentences>

## Steps

1. <action> — *Why:* <reason>. *Verify:* <how to confirm>.
2. <action> — *Why:* <reason>. *Verify:* <how to confirm>.

## Tests

> Tier: <1 (code-touching) | 2 (non-code)>

### Objective-Verification Test

- **File:** `<test file path>`
- **Type:** mock/smoke test
- **Asserts:** <what the test confirms about the plan's stated objective>
- **Run:** `<test runner command>`

### Unit Tests *(Tier 1 only — omit for Tier 2)*

- **File:** `<test file path>`
- **Targets:** <function/module under test>
- **Key cases:** <what scenarios are covered>

### Integration Tests *(Tier 1 only — omit for Tier 2)*

- **File:** `<test file path>`
- **Targets:** <modules/services exercised together>
- **Key cases:** <what interactions are covered>

### E2E Tests *(Tier 1 only — omit for Tier 2)*

- **File:** `<test file path>`
- **Targets:** <user flow driven through the running application>
- **Key cases:** <what user scenarios are covered>

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] <falsifiable condition that must be true for this plan to be done>
- [ ] <another condition>

## Verification

<end-to-end confirmation>

## Next Steps *(optional)*

- <label for the follow-up>:
  ```text
  <Self-contained prompt the user can paste into Claude to execute this
  follow-up. Include enough context that no prior plan reading is required.
  Example: "Scan every plan under docs/plans/ that has a Next Steps section
  with single-line bullets and rewrite them to the label + fenced-prompt
  shape. Skip completed plans. Report a list of files changed.">
  ```

## Unresolved Questions *(optional — omit if none)*

- <label for the open question>:
  ```text
  <Self-contained prompt asking Claude to investigate and recommend.
  Example: "Should the new requirement in plan-mode.md be advisory or
  enforced by a PostToolUse hook? Recommend one approach with reasoning,
  and if a hook is right, draft the minimum-viable check that avoids
  false-positives on completed plans or plans with no follow-ups.">
